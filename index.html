            <p>I got connected with Deutsche Bank during my involvement with the Society of Hispanic Engineers, or SHPE. After meeting representatives at the SHPE National Convention, I was excited to explore the intersection of my combined major program, computer science and business. During this internship, I gained hands-on experience with various different software tools, such as OpenShift and Jenkins. I contributed to a software development team and worked, among other things, on updating and maintaining databases. As part of a team following agile methodologies, I gained a much better understanding of the software development lifecyle. Because I was working online, I gained experience through virtual scrum calls, sprint plannings, team meetings, and one-on-ones.  </p>

            <p>As someone allergic to free time, when I heard through my involvement in AthenaHacks about the opportunity to attend a summer conference for hackathon organizers in Pennsylvania, I jumped at the chance. A few panels and fireside chats later, I was hooked. I learned about what it meant to be a part of the global student hacker community, and it clicked for me that the MLH Coach role was exactly what I had been looking for. It was a chance to empower people outside my local community while still learning and growing myself. As a Coach, I travel to student hackathons and represent MLH, providing resources and mentorship for event organizers and attendees. While I was lucky enough to travel to Boston, San Jose, and Dallas, my travel is paused for now. I've been keeping busy by contributing digitally in the form of facilitating online technical workshops for the Localhost program, as well as staffing digital events.</p>

            <p>Closing the gender gap in technology is something I am passionate about, and something I have spent a lot of time working on, carving out space for women in tech one step at a time. Girls Who Code is the non-profit organization that jumpstarted my tech career, and when deciding what I wanted to do this summer, I knew I had to give back. As a TA for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (partnered with Warner Brothers), I guided a class of twenty girls, teaching them the basics of computer science using languages and programs like Scratch, Python, Arduino C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This work was meaningful for me because I get to guide the next wave of computer scientists. I'm proud to have had a hand in the girls' journey into tech. My time as a Girl Who Codes was three years ago, and spending time with these amazing students reminded me why I decided to study computer science in the first place. This is the summer I learned about sisterhood.</p>

            <p>Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, Universal Studios Hollywood has always existed in my peripheral. After graduating high school, I knew I needed a summer job, not necessarily for the money (though it helped), but because I have never been the kind of person to sit still when presented with the chance to do something, to grow. And grow I did. I met people from all walks of life and spent up to eight hour shifts on my feet, bussing tables, selling food and drinks at vending carts, and (my personal favorite,) making and serving Butterbeer to Harry Potter superfans. This was the summer I learned about the true meaning of hard work, of giving your all for even the smallest task (and the magic of shoe insoles!).</p>

            <p>I applied to this program through Questbridge. I answered the prompts and gave them my resume, never thinking that anything would come of it. As a first-generation Mexican-American, I didn't think that programs like this were for people like me. Spending three weeks by myself in a different state when I had never even left California (except to drive to Mexico) required a huge leap of faith for me and my family. When I received the phone call that I would be flown across the country to Northfield, Minnesota, and be a part of a three-week program on a full scholarship, I was in shock. After taking a few minutes to recover, I told my parents and got ready to get to work. There, I learned the basics of programming, robotics, and human-computer interaction. If Girls Who Code got me started on programming, then this was the summer I learned about what it meant to be a computer scientist, to want to go above and beyond for something that means a lot.</p>

            <p>Girls Who Code fell in my lap through serendipity. I remember that I got a random email as a high school sophomore, and the subject line was, "Do you want to stand out in college applications?" Being a forward-thinking go-getter, I said, "Of course!" And I am very, very glad I did. At the time, I more or less knew that I wanted to study computer science, but I honesly wasn't sure what it was. This was a big summer of firsts for me. My parents worked and couldn't drive me to and from the program, so I learned to take the Metro for the first time, had an hour-long commute for the first time, and wrote my first "hello world" program. From there, everything fell into place. I was introduced to programming concepts I didn't even know were possible. My final project was a website dedicated to spreading awareness of and giving support to survivors of college campus sexual assault, inspired by the documentary The Hunting Ground (on Netflix!). This was the summer I learned about what it really takes to be a girl who codes.</p>
